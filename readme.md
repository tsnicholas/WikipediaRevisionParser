Developed by Timothy Nicholas (tsnicholas@bsu.edu) and Anthony Miller (acmiller@bsu.edu).  
This program is used to retrieve the usernames of the last
30 users who edited the given wikipedia page. It also retrieves
the timestamps of when the users did those edits.
To use this program, you simply type the name of the wikipedia 
page you want to receive data from and hit the search button.
If the page exists, the program will print the last 30 revisions
below the search button. If the page doesn't exist, the user will
be informed via the same way. If there's a network connection error,
the user will be alerted with a pop-up window. Same goes with other errors
that might occur.
